# Story Development

## Required Knowledge

Read only the reference needed for the active task, not this entire list.
The root v2 route owns scope and authorization; legacy records do not add gates.

- `docs/film-preproduction/chat-co-creation-interface.md`
- `docs/film-preproduction/chat-inline-visualization-interface.md`
- `docs/film-preproduction/creative-copy-deck-capability.md`
- `docs/film-preproduction/professional-agent-voice-standard.md`
- `docs/film-preproduction/schemas/story-package.yaml`
- `docs/film-preproduction/research/channel-playbooks.md`

## Inputs

- selected concept
- director-room notes
- channel and duration

## Outputs

- logline
- beat sheet
- treatment
- source bindings and concept substitutability check
- story review

## Chat Surface

Deliver the complete requested story, not a preview that withholds its ending.
Use readable paragraphs, observable beats and enough dramatic or perceptual
change for the genre and duration. Explain a recommendation only where it helps.
If script development is also requested, continue after the internal story check.
Use concept_lock only for an unresolved material choice reserved for the user.

## Quality Gate

Review against the requested form. Causal drama needs protagonist, goal, obstacle, stakes and a meaningful turn. Lyrical/observational work needs perceptual, rhythmic or relational progression with an intentional ending. Every form must fit its channel/duration and contain screenable beats.

Check whether the concept survives replacing the product, setting or relationship with an unrelated one. For a formal `distinctive` verdict under the source-bound schema, also apply the following recorded checks:

- Record at least two alternatives with unique IDs and proximity reasons, then select the nearest one by ID into `swap_subject`.
- Record `before_swap` and `after_swap` while holding concept wording and beat order constant.
- Set `still_works_without_rewrite: false` only when the replacement breaks the mechanism, proof, relationship, setting, or payoff.
- Record at least two concrete `broken_dependency_ids` that resolve to `specific_dependencies`.
- Record `concept_author_id`; require an `independent_reviewer` whose reviewer ID differs from it, with `independent_from_concept_author: true` and a passing review status.
- Set `verdict: distinctive` only after those checks pass.
- Reject a concept that survives with noun replacement, even when its title, mood, or imagery sounds original.

Bind the story package to the approved fact, source-evidence, and inference IDs. The source arrays and IDs fail closed; preserve the audience-tension evidence and proposition facts used by the story. Every outline beat needs a unique ID plus `source_fact_ids` and `source_inference_ids` that resolve through the story binding. Keep inference-based creative moves labeled as professional judgment. Do not introduce an audience-facing commercial claim that is absent from the project's approved claim register.

For causal dramatic shorts, use the following story-engine checks when relevant:

- external pressure that forces action now, not only atmosphere,
- a hidden relationship engine, secret, misunderstanding, exchange, debt, or promise that changes the two-person dynamic,
- an irreversible choice or reveal before the ending,
- escalation from setup to pressure to reversal to consequence,
- a visible ending action that changes how the viewer reads the relationship,
- a reason the setting is a plot device, not just a mood background.

A dramatic story needs screenable change and consequence. An explicitly lyrical, observational or gentle film may build through perception, rhythm or relational change; do not force a secret, threat or irreversible event to satisfy a template.

Use this dramatic pressure card internally when it exposes a real story weakness; do not add a second artifact merely to repeat the treatment:

```text
Want:
Obstacle:
Tactic:
Subtext:
Turn/reveal:
Irreversible consequence:
Visible ending action:
Setting as plot device:
```

Reject if the card contains abstractions instead of specific screenable facts.

## Visual Decision Contract

When visualization adds clarity, use `skills/dircreative/assets/visualizations/stage-surface-registry.json#story-beat-ribbon`. Bind the beginning, turn, proof, ending, tension, and downstream effect to the story package; submit approval or revision intent to the current story gate and preserve the Mermaid fallback.

## Rules

- Keep the story executable for the target duration.
- Make the audience tension, business objective, single-minded proposition, and avoid-cliches visible in the concept decision when the project has commercial intent.
- Reject category cliches that reproduce an item in `avoid_cliches` without a project-specific reversal or consequence.
- Client story work needs readable, complete story paragraphs. Review story quality internally before expanding the requested script; do not require a separate user approval.
- Preserve every source-brief requirement not explicitly removed by the user. If an old route, alternate direction, customer prop, story bone, character count, or client-provided object is not used, record it as `omitted_requirements_without_user_removal` and block downstream work.
- If a prop list uses an ellipsis, treat it as examples. Expand the prop logic into each relevant character's role identity, prop, action, and shot function before approval.
- Explain why the story direction fits the channel, duration, first-hook timing, emotional turn, and reference-pack needs.
- If the user asks for visual exploration, story rebuild, formal lockable material, retry, thread/workflow audit, or live acceptance, name that intent before continuing.
- Before dependent script/shot/asset work, review progression and ending against the requested form. Require tension/causal escalation for causal drama; use perception, rhythm and relationship changes for observational or lyrical work. Never add a forbidden crisis or reveal to satisfy the dramatic template.
- Do not use visual polish to compensate for weak story or script work. When a story change invalidates downstream decisions, mark downstream visual assets as not locked before returning to story development.
- Resolve actual story defects before dependent script work; a passed internal review is sufficient within the user-authorized scope.
- Do not write shot lists or prompts.

## skill_run_receipt

Persist the following only for a requested formal handoff, pause/resume or actual
execution record. Ordinary work returns its result without a separate receipt.
The next skill is advisory; the controller continues only the requested scope.

Record source-binding status, alternatives considered, selected swap and before/after result, broken dependency IDs, independent reviewer receipt, concept substitutability verdict, story gate status, claim-boundary status, and `next_recommended_skill: script-treatment`.
