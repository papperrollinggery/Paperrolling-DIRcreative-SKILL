## Inputs

- shot list
- reference pack plan
- reference pack manifest
- image prompt manifest
- audio policy

## Outputs

- video prompt manifest
- model-specific prompt files
- adapter risk notes
- external generation upload map when assets are not generated locally
- exact capability-card, rights, audio-route, and preserve/change receipts

## Chat Surface

Return the complete copyable prompt for the selected model and requested unit,
with its actual upload order and reference roles. Do not hide prompts backstage
or reopen a model choice already supplied. Give multiple model variants only
when requested. A multi-unit delivery may contain separate independently copyable
prompts for every requested unit; never concatenate them as one oversized call.
Do not export a generation-ready run that pretends missing clean frames exist.
Real video execution requires its own existing or new scoped authorization.

## Visual Decision Contract

When visualization adds clarity, use `skills/dircreative/assets/visualizations/stage-surface-registry.json#video-route-capability-comparison`. Compare exact model, duration, reference slots, audio, evidence status, and route risk from current capability cards; model choice remains a conversation intent with a table fallback.

## Rules

- Use different prompt strategies per model.
- When `convert-script-to-seedance` is selected, apply
  `script_to_seedance_v1`: pass only locked authoritative script, canonical
  shots/timecodes, generation units, entity ownership, continuity, asset ledger,
  audio policy, and exact model surface. Consume its unit prompts and slot ledger
  back into the DIR manifest; do not accept a second creative pass. Validate the
  machine packet before export. Only available/attached bindings enter prompts;
  planned audio, human-only boards, over-budget reference sets, illegal state
  transitions, and mismatched global/local slot numbers fail closed.
  Also attach the validated staged asset-foundation pass and stress-test report;
  the handoff validator rechecks their real file hashes, stage coverage, verdict,
  and requested shot scope before a validated converter handoff is exportable.
  If assets are still missing, the existing DIR prompt craft can deliver a
  clearly labeled prompt-only draft with its missing bindings. It is not a
  validated converter result or an executable submission.
- When the target is Seedance 2.5, retain the same compiler/validator chain and
  apply `mr-li-seedance-25` 1.9.0 first as the isolated method collaborator.
  Bind its visual-baseline, prompt-writing, duration, heading-free format and
  full-flow regression references; apply its pre-write capacity, speaker-change cut and one-natural-
  segment rules. Target intent alone never authorizes model capability or execution.
- After prompt preflight, send only the final generation candidate—not drafts—to
  `ai-film-production-ledger`. The Ledger records a `planned` attempt until a
  separate generation authorization and real execution evidence exist.
- Resolve `capability_card_id + version + provider_surface` before naming reference modes, duration, native audio, edit, extension, or upload slots. Reject family aliases, `latest`, stale cards, S4-only evidence, workflow-only cards, deprecated defaults, and preview aliases when a stable endpoint is current.
- Preserve `verified_on`, `accessed_on`, source tier/URLs, status/deprecation, and official-source conflicts in the manifest. If the live execution surface differs from the card or a conflict remains material, stay prompt-only.
- Run the rights gate before binding image, video, audio, character, element, likeness, voice, brand/character, or music inputs. Unverified/blocked rights prevent generation and external upload.
- Apply the production prompt discipline pre-delivery harness to the selected model and active unit: source/asset bindings, model constraints, prompt-window hygiene and falsifiable success criteria. Do not audit unrelated models or stages.
- Every generated/reference image must either map to a video prompt role or be explicitly marked human-planning-only.
- If image prompts are exported, also export the corresponding video prompt reference binding: model, shot_id, upload slot, direct/secondary/planning role, and risk note.
- Read `visual_output_mode` before referencing images.
- In `prompt_only`, bind expected reference slots and write external generation instructions instead of pretending files exist.
- In `assisted_generation`, use only real assets accepted for the requested dependency scope by the required review/adoption contract; preserve any explicit user-reserved selection.
- Do not use generated assets rejected for character drift, scene drift, duplicated visual contradictions, missing role labels, or low storyboard density.
- Model prompts must bind to the locked character identity source and locked scene geography/camera FOV source; do not allow each prompt to reinterpret them.
- The professional storyboard/motion page is planning-only. Use it to translate timing, lens, camera movement, blocking, sound, transition, and model risk, not as a literal video frame.
- In `external_generation`, export tool-specific upload order, start/end frame rules, and reference roles.
- For TapNow-style canvas workflows, export a model input graph showing prompt nodes, image nodes, clean-frame nodes, and video nodes.
- Include reference map and anti-misread clause.
- Include audio policy as a separate section.
- Separate `desired_audio` from `generation_audio_route`. Native audio is valid only when the exact card/surface supports it; otherwise use reference/preserve/post-production/none and write the handoff. Image prompt metadata never proves an audio route.
- For edit, extension, and retry operations, declare non-overlapping `preserve` and `change` sets plus forbidden changes. Keep one-variable retry behavior.
- Respect each asset's `direct_input_policy`.
- Verify model constraints before naming aspect ratios, durations, media roles, audio behavior, clean-frame requirements, or upload slots. If current schema evidence is unavailable, mark the prompt as prompt-only or external-generation with a risk note.
- Every video prompt must satisfy the five-layer check: model, camera, subject, look, and action.
- Every scene prompt must satisfy the six-slot check: camera, subject, action, setting, style, and lighting.
- Every video prompt must pass the micro-scene beat-sheet check before export: initial visible state, trigger or pressure, subject action path, camera start target, camera end target, timing beat or pause, final visible state, and sound or silence policy where relevant.
- Do not overfit to public Reddit, X, or prompt-library recipes. Use them only as structure after verifying model facts and binding the prompt to DIRcreative source truth, material role, reference map, and falsifiable QA.
- Do not use `master_reference_board`, `storyboard_motion_board`, `professional_storyboard_motion_map`, or `environment_camera_board` as a literal first-frame input. They default to planning-only; bind a separate clean frame to an exact supported first/end-frame mode.
- If an asset came from Creative Production, confirm the adapter receipt says `render_moodboard_board_widget` is not the source of truth and that the asset was written back as `generated_candidate`, `user_locked`, `rejected`, or `external_imported`.
- Do not use a Creative Production `generated_candidate` as video truth until generation QA and the required independent visual review/host dependency adoption are bound in DIRcreative artifacts. This does not assert user acceptance.
- For any exact first/end-frame workflow, keep direct generation blocked unless the selected clean frames are generated or imported, self-QA/rights pass, and the required independent visual review/host dependency adoption is recorded. A user-reserved acceptance decision still belongs to the user.
- If the selected mode is all-reference or text-to-video, explain why clean frames are not required and record the accepted risk.
- In `prompt_only`, list required image prompt files and the upload slot each one will occupy.
- For `sora_2_openai_videos_api` or Pro, use image input only as a clean first-frame anchor, keep non-human character assets separate, enforce current rights restrictions, and route create/edit/extension separately.
- For `seedance_2_0_official_launch`, bind `@image`, `@video`, and `@audio` roles explicitly; keep every published limit scoped to version 2.0 and mark access `documented_product`, export `manual_export`, execution `unverified`.
- For `kling_video_3_0_official_guide`, use the current 3-15-second card and bind single/multi-shot, start/end frames, elements, and audio distinctly. Mark access `documented_product`, export `manual_export`, execution `unverified`; use the 5/10-second rule only when `kling_legacy_i2v_5_10_official_guide` is explicitly selected.
- For Runway, use `runway_gen_4_5_web` only for new generation. Resolve edits by surface: `runway_aleph_2_0_web` keeps numeric duration unverified for Edit Studio, while `runway_aleph_2_0_api` authorizes model `aleph2` and 2-30 second API inputs. Reject `runway_gen_4_aleph_api_deprecated` for new work and preserve its deprecation in the receipt.
- For Veo on Vertex, select the exact endpoint card. The stable `veo_3_1_generate_001_vertex_api` and `veo_3_1_fast_generate_001_vertex_api` cards default to post-production audio because their exact page says sound generation is unsupported and the registered generic API URL does not bind `generateAudio` to either card. Keep the source conflict visible. Only an exact endpoint card such as Lite may retain native audio when its own page explicitly supports sound; never generalize that fact across Veo tiers.
- Mark model prompts blocked if required clean first frames or locked references are missing.
- Missing required media blocks executable submission readiness. A prompt-only draft may still be delivered with the unresolved input named; legacy clean_frame_gate/video_prompt_gate are read-only compatibility fields.
- For longform work, export prompts per sequence pack and preserve sequence IDs for edit assembly.
- Retry prompts must change one variable at a time: subject/product identity, primary action, camera/shot size, look/material/light, reference binding, or output controls. Record the failure ID and the smallest upstream artifact being corrected.
- Do not let a graph edge connect a dense board directly to a literal I2V node unless the asset role and model policy allow it.
- In `prompt_only` and `external_generation`, do not call video tools. In an
  authorized video-generation handoff, return the validated prompt and bindings
  to the Delivery executor; this adapter does not perform the media call itself.
- Run the executable Prompt IR schema and semantic validator before adaptation. Compile only references marked `attached_to_run: true`; planning-only assets, missing slots, internal IDs, paths, hashes, QA/retry fields, and post-production-only audio are forbidden on the terminal prompt surface.
- Every person/product/prop action and every dialogue or event sound must resolve to a valid entity owner. Targets longer than one generation unit require contiguous units with exact adjacent handoff keys/states and audio handoff. Compile each unit with locally rebased timing. Deliver every requested unit as a separate copyable prompt; never present a multi-unit assembly plan as one model-executable prompt.

## Prompt IR, composition, and conditional Look closure

Before model adaptation, consume the model-neutral Prompt IR and its intake record. Prefer user/client/project-supplied locked assets over unlocked candidates or model imagination. Verify every source path/hash/role/inheritance before compiling slots. Use one selected model adapter per run; do not emit parallel model prompts unless the user explicitly selects them.

The adapter must preserve these fields in the exported prompt:

- composition: visual center, hierarchy, foreground/midground/background, negative space, movement room, leading lines/occlusion/parallax, screen direction, and purpose;
- subject action, object action, and environment action as initial state, trigger, path, physical consequence, and final state;
- camera shot size, angle/height/axis, lens reason, support, start target, path, end target, speed/easing, focus, and motivation;
- time-coded emotional or attention beats, audio cues, transition bridges, and continuity locks;
- render look layers lighting, optics, atmosphere, and grade, each with condition, effect, intensity, preserve, and exit/continuity.

For Seedance 2.0, compile internal assets to platform roles such as @Image 1, @Video 1, and @Audio 1. Never expose R-number labels, internal asset ids, local paths, or manifest instructions in the final pasted prompt. Planning boards remain planning_only; clean frames are the direct visual anchors.

After prompt compilation, return prompt_only or instructions_only unless there is a verified external generation receipt. The receipt must include self-QA, current status, next_action, user lock state, and explicit unverified external work. Do not stop silently after writing the prompt.

## skill_run_receipt

Persist the following only for a requested formal handoff, pause/resume or actual
execution record. Ordinary work returns its result without a separate receipt.
The next skill is advisory; the controller continues only the requested scope.

Record model adapters, exact capability cards/version/status/provider surfaces, source tiers/dates/deprecations/conflicts, rights status, desired audio and generation audio route, preserve/change contracts, visual output mode, reference asset bindings, storyboard/clean-frame separation, optional model input graph, missing/generated/external asset status, forbidden direct inputs avoided, E0-E6 status, risk notes, QA status, and `next_recommended_skill: generation-qa`.
